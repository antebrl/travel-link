## App idea

Planning a trip involves considerable preparation and organization, from choosing the destination and accommodations to arranging transportation and creating an itinerary. But the struggle intensifies when you're coordinating a group adventure. Suddenly, you're not just considering your own preferences and needs, but those of multiple individuals with varying schedules, interests, and expectations. 

Our app aims to facilitate the organization of trips and enhance collaboration within a travel group to make the planning process easier and faster. The app, therefore, includes valuable features such as:

- Easily solving tedious planning tasks centrally with shared checklists and surveys.
- Aggregating planned activities for a comprehensive overview by creating a travel plan with the activities to be visited.
- Improving the communication with a group chat.
- Simplifying the tracking of travel costs and allocation of expenses among group members.
- Saving memories in a shared gallery directly linked to the trip.

Even if you don't have any fellow travelers for an adventure trip, the app offers you the possibility to join or create publicly organized trips to connect with other travelers.
