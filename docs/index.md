# Project documentation

Our project is an app that aims to make it easier and better to organize and plan trips of all kinds.

Many trips are difficult to organize and in many cases cause displeasure and misunderstandings among travelers. With our app, tedious planning tasks can be solved easily and centrally. The app makes it easy to complete organizational tasks such as creating a travel plan with the activities to be visited. Planning is simplified by organizational elements such as checklists.

Travel groups often encounter difficulties when it comes to allocating travel costs. Especially when many travellers are involved, organization and subsequent accounting can be difficult, as it can be challenging to keep track of all costs and expenses. For this reason, our app offers a cost analysis function that allows me to easily and clearly settle expenses with group members.

In order to maintain communication during the trip, the app offers elements such as chats, surveys and location histories so that all group members are always up to date and the trip runs smoothly.

Even if you don't have any fellow travelers for a trip idea, that's no problem with our app. The app offers the possibility to create trips that are organized either privately or publicly. A search function allows other users to join public travel groups in order to find out details about the trip and join in if necessary.
