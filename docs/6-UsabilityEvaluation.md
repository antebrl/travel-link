# Usability Evaluation

In this section, we conduct a comprehensive usability evaluation of our app to ensure it meets the needs and expectations of our users. Usability evaluation is a critical step in the development process, as it helps identify areas where users may encounter difficulties, allowing us to make necessary improvements to enhance the overall user experience.

The following methods were employed in our usability evaluation:

1. Cognitive Walkthrough
2. Heuristic Evaluation by 1 Team Member
3. Thinking Aloud Tests
4. Accessibility Check


## Cognitve Walkthrough

**Goal:** To identify potential usability issues by simulating the user's thought process while performing tasks in the app.

**Process:** A usability expert empathizes with a persona, goes through a list of tasks, and checks if the user would complete them as intended.

**Questions considered:**

Will the user try and achieve the right outcome?

Will the user notice that the correct action is available to them?

Will the user associate the correct action with the outcome they 
expect to achieve?

If the correct action is performed, will the user see that progress is being made towards their intended outcome?

**Given tasks:**

The User was supposed to explore and complete the most important tasks:

- Explore activities 
    - Use search bar to find activities in Barcelona
    - Find most popular activiites in Africa
    - Find details about a activity
- Create a trip
- Add activity to trip

For detailed description of the steps check the section: [User Evaluation](user-research/user-evaluation.md)

**Results**

- The user was mostly able to complete the tasks correctly. This was primarily due to the intuitive design and the use of recurring and familiar elements, such as tapping on an activity to view its details or using the search bar or the ability to swipe between different screens.

- Another reason was the clear labeling of buttons, like "Add a new Activity." This helped users understand exactly what would happen and what they would achieve. However, the option was a little bit hidden and not very intuitive to find.

- We found that users were unclear on how to create a trip, as we used a simple button with a "+" symbol. This indicates that labeling buttons is important especially for new users.

- Users receive a notification in the snackbar indicating that e.g. an activity was successfully added. Additionally it is displayed in the activity list. This feedback helps users know they have achieved the intended outcome.
