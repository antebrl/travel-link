Creating a promo video for our mobile app is essential to effectively showcase its features and benefits to potential users. This visual and engaging medium allows us to highlight the app's unique selling points in a concise and compelling manner. A well-crafted video can capture attention quickly, making it easier to convey the app's value proposition compared to text-based descriptions.

Our first screen recording, where we showcased the majority of our app functionality, was over 8 minutes long, which is way too long for a promo video. By cutting out unnecessary loading times and speeding up the process of typing into text fields, we were able to shorten the video to under 4 minutes.

We, as a group, decided that further cutting would destroy the flow, and a person who has never seen our app would not be able to follow the walkthrough properly.
