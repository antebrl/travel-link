## Self reflection
Creating the TraveLink App has been an interesting journey. Through the process, we gained a much better understanding of design principles. We learned the real challenge of balancing aesthetics with functionality. We aimed to make thoughtful decisions for all design aspects, such as color schemes and user flow. Often, we encountered situations where we had multiple solutions. In those cases, we trusted our instincts and are very happy with how the design turned out.

Of course, we faced challenges, but by discussing these problems within our group, we often found great solutions. One example was the debate over whether there should be a central login screen when the app starts, requiring the user to create an account, or if we should only require a login for features needing personal information. In a meeting, we concluded that we would add a central login screen at the beginning, but with the option for the user to click on a "try anonymous" button. This is common in many well-tested apps and was the perfect compromise for us. This project really strengthened our creativity and attention to detail. Ultimately, designing this app has been more than an academic exercise.
