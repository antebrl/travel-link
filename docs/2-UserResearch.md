# NZSE User Research
[Based on Prof. Dr. Stefan Zander](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA0DlfghMAY&t=1s)
## 1. User list
- Jakob
- Julian
- Morten
- Mats

## 2. Criteria list
- Age 
- Wealth
- adventurousness
- leisure time
- languages
- travel experience
- planning experience
- smartphone/pc experience
- education

### 2.1 Operationalization
We have decided to quantify the criteria on a scale from 0 to 10 so that it is easier to compare the values later on
- e.g. Age: ~20=3 ~40=5 ~80=10
- e.g. languages: native language + basic second language = 3. 3 languages = 6. 5+ languages = 10
- etc. 

## 3. Create Matrix

## 4. N-Dimentional Vector Space
For a three dimentional vector space we choose the criterias: **age**, **adventurousness** and **travel experience**

*Hier wird dann das Koordinatensystem eingef√ºgt*

## 4.1 Persona
We choose the most extreme User for each criteria, as highlighted in the image above. Now we will create a Persona describtion for every persona.
