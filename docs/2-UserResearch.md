# NZSE User Research
[Based on Prof. Dr. Stefan Zander](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA0DlfghMAY&t=1s)
## 1. User list
- Jakob
- Julian
- Morten
- Mats
- (See the table below for more)

## 2. Criteria list
- Age 
- Wealth
- Adventurousness
- Free time
- Languages
- Travel experience
- Planning experience
- Smartphone/pc experience

### 2.1 Operationalization
We have decided to quantify the criteria on a scale from 0 to 10 so that it is easier to compare the values later on
- e.g. Age: ~20=3 ~40=5 ~80=10
- e.g. languages: native language + basic second language = 3. 3 languages = 6. 5+ languages = 10
- etc.
